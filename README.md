getUserMedia on WebKit PoC
==========================

This short code shows some effects in WebKit browsers: getUserMedia (images from webcam) with some filters avaliable in WebKit (sephia, blur, grayscale etc.).

Unfortunatelly this code doesn't work properly in Firefox. 

Nothing special, just Saturday's evening... :P
